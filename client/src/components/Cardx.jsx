            Trees are woody perennial plants that are a member of the kingdom{" "}
            <em>Plantae</em>. All species of trees are grouped by their genus,
            family, and order. This helps make identifying and studying trees
            easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from providing oxygen for the planet and beauty when they
            bloom or turn color, trees are very useful. Certain species of
            hardwood and softwood trees are excellent for timber, making
            furniture, and paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            When managed properly, trees are a good source of renewable energy
            and construction material.
